AIM : Create an android application which demonstrates implicit & explicit Intent.

About : 
The "Intent Demo" Android app demonstrates the use of both implicit and explicit intents in Android. The app includes a main activity with buttons for each type of intent. 
When the explicit intent button is clicked, it directly starts another activity within the app, showing a message or image to indicate successful navigation. 
The implicit intent button triggers an action that opens an external app, such as a web browser or phone dialer, based on the specified intent action 
(e.g., Intent.ACTION_VIEW to open a URL or Intent.ACTION_DIAL to open the dialer). This app provides a clear, interactive demonstration of the differences between implicit 
and explicit intents, illustrating how intents can be used to start specific activities both within and outside of the app.
